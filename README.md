===================

### post mortem
* bad wifi, tether to phone
* too many integrations (didnt need strongloop)
* auth0 signed up for ALL the auths, should have just done one or two
* try to "learn" too many things
* don't forget to update the auth0 host on heroku
* not sure what to do with complete beginners
* tried Trello, crunch time came fast and threw all that out the window
* need a vga adapter
* bring whiteboard markers
* sign up for accounts with all the things the night before
* do the quick samples of the frameworks when Lukas posts them
* don't bother with gulp, doing concat and all that there is no time for a proper build, just mash it all in master
* do practice "reps" beforehand
